Track your daily water intake from the terminal. Made with Node and has some customizability.  
For myself, a chronic dehydrate.

## Install  
```bash
npm install -g watracker
```

## Usage

```bash
watracker [command] [options]
```
Note: I recommend aliasing it to 'wat' or something.


## Commands

| Command     | Description                     |

| `d`, `drink`     | Log a cup of water              |
| `u`, `undrink`   | Remove a cup from today         |
| `s`, `set`       | Set configuration options       |

## Config Options (for `set`)

- `goal` â€“ daily goal (e.g. `goal=8`)
- `max` â€“ how many cups to show full bar (e.g. `max=12`)
- `scale` â€“ how much each cup adds (e.g. `scale=4`)

```bash
watracker d                    # You drank a cup
watracker u                    # You undrank a cup
