# Track you water intake per day with this simple CLI tool! ðŸ’§

## For myself, a chronic dehydrate. Made using Node with water-tracking features and some customizability.  

### Run using `npm start`, add args such as:
- `d` or `drink`: you drank a cup of water!
- `u` or `undrink`: you undrank a cup of water!
- `s` or `set`: set configuration options  
  - `goal`: how much cups of water you want to drink per day  
  - `cap`: maximum amount of water you want to track per day  
  - `scale`: how much progress each cup of water adds  
  - `rows`: how many days (including today) to show
  - `Ex: npm start set goal=8`
